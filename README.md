  - Web app with Students and Houses.

## MVP:
  - Add the RESTful routes for the students resource into the students controller
  - Add the corresponding views

## IMPORTANT Notes:
  - In this start code we have two models (with corresponding db tables) Student and House (One House can have MANY students)

  - We've included a hard-coded select in new.erb so you can specify the house when you create a student. Remember this is based on the relationship - a student references the houses table via house_id.

  - You'll want to make this dynamic at some point - ie based on the actual database. Right now we're assuming that the four houses have ids 1-4. How can we get hold of the houses and make sure we use the right house_id in our form even if we've been deleting from our tables? (Meaning the ids might not start at 1)

  - In our edit view we'll want to make our select reflect the current house of the student we are editing. You'll need to research how to set the state of a select - aka which option is currently selected. (you can also look at the pizza_shop solution)
